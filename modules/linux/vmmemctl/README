The files in this directory are the source files for the VMware
Memory Control driver.  In order to build, make certain the
Makefile is correct, especially about whether or not your system is
multi-processor or not, and then just type:

	make

from this directory.  A copy of the module will be left in 'vmmemctl.o',
which can then be installed in /lib/modules/<kernel-name>/misc.
