open-vm-tools 2009.05.22 changes:
	* Mostly a cleanup and bug fix release.

	* Fix a build issue where a symlink attack could cause the open-vm-tools
	build to overwrite data (by placing a symlink in /tmp).

	* Second (and last?) batch of changes to clean up duplicate files
	in the source tree, including Solaris and FreeBSD kernel modules and
	other module-specific shared files.

	* Plugins now are properly built using plugins_LTLIBRARIES so that
	"-rpath" doesn't need to be used (this would cause an RPATH entry to
	be added to the final binary, which some tools didn't like). Thanks to
	Dominique Leuenberger for the suggestion.

	* open-vm-tools now properly detects PAM and enables PAM support in the
	code.

open-vm-tools 2009.04.23 changes:
	* Implemented copy & paste support for RTF data and file contents.

	* guestd has been removed from open-vm-tools; vmtoolsd is now the only
	option for the main tools service.

	* Added vmblock and vmmemctl modules for Solaris (under the CDDL).

	* vmware-user can now work with both vmblock-fuse and vmblock.

	* Linux HGFS now has a stream-based (TCP, vsock) transport, still under
	development.

	* First batch of changes to cleanup duplicated files in the source tree.
	Most duplicated files in the Linux kernel modules have been cleaned up.

open-vm-tools 2009.03.18 changes:
	* Mostly a bug fix release.

	* Solaris vmxnet3 driver was added; open-vm-tools now should also compile on
	OpenSolaris (tested on 08.11), as long as the --without-gtkmm option is used.

	* The new DnD V3 protocol is now available in open-vm-tools.

	* Added "rpctool", a simple, stand-alone tool to send RPC commands to the
	host software.

	* vmtoolsd is now preferred in lieu of vmware-guestd; vmware-guestd will
	most probably be completely removed in the next release.

open-vm-tools 2009.02.18 changes:
	* open-vm-tools now depend on glib 2.6.0 as a minimum requirement.

	* Added vmxnet module for Solaris, and reworked the HGFS module so it
	works without help from vmware-guestd.

	* Added implementation of new DnD protocol, which adds a dependency on
	a C++ compiler and the gtkmm library to vmware-user.

	* The code from the "core services" has been added to open-vm-tools,
	including a few tests. vmtoolsd + plugins are now capable of replacing
	vmware-guestd (vmware-user still needs to have some features ported
	over), but this code is still not to be considered as stable as the
	legacy services, so vmware-guestd is still included.

	* A few fixes for compatibility with non-GNU toolchains, newer Linux
	kernels and old gcc compilers.

open-vm-tools 2009.01.21 changes:
	* First open source release of the HGFS module for Solaris, under the CDDL.
	Other modules are expected to be added in the upcoming releases.

	* Added an implementation of vmblock on top of FUSE; vmware-user still
	doesn't use this module even if it is available, though.

	* Linux modules now add the "supported" tag used by Novell in their
	SLES 10 SP2 release when loading modules.

	* Fix compilation of modules in newer Linux kernels which don't include
	$(LINUXINCLUDE) in the compiler flags anymore.

open-vm-tools 2008.12.23 changes:
	* Lots of makefile cleanup with the switch to using libtool archives.

	* Automatically disable Unity if multimon support is disabled.

	* Actually build the pvscsi modules.

	* First bits of the "Core Service" project are starting to show up; the
	base "vmtools" library was added to the package. It currently is mostly
	a collection of the existing libraries already shipped with open-vm-tools,
	plus some extra functionality build on top of glib. Currently no other
	code in open-vm-tools uses it, so it's optional.

	* The HGFS driver was fixed for the Linux 2.6.28 kernel.

open-vm-tools 2009.11.18 changes:
	* The pvscsi Linux kernel module has been added (for kernels >= 2.6.8).
	It provides access to VMware's new paravirtualized SCSI device.

	* The HGFS driver and user-level code has seen a lot of refactoring to
	enable more consistent name escaping. The FreeBSD driver now supports
	symlinks.

	* The Linux module makefiles now support exporting symbol version files,
	allowing modules with dependencies (such as vsock, which depends on vmci)
	to correctly build and load on Linux >= 2.6.26 with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.

	* Rudimentary support for dkms.

	* Assortment of bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2009.10.13 changes:
	* The vmxnet3 Linux kernel module has been added. This module provides
	better network performance for the guest. The corresponding virtual
	hardware is available beginning with Workstation 6.5, though
	performance benefits are unlikely to be realized until a later VMware
	product release. The module should work for all kernels beginning with
	2.6.

	* The open-vm-tools no longer depend on libproc-dev. Several people
	reported this issue (Sourceforge bug 1960947).

	* Added a command line argument to skip privileged operations during
	make install (--without-root-privileges).

	* Guestd now supports backwards time synchronization, though the
	corresponding hypervisor-side changes are not yet part of any shipping
	VMware products.
	
	* Assortment of bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2009.09.03 changes:
	* Fixed an issue where open-vm-tools fails to configure when using
	--without-icu. Thanks to Timo Gurr for reporting the issue (Sourceforge
	bug 2046262).

	* Fixed failed build on Ubuntu Intrepid and Fedora 9. Thanks to Nathan
	Charles for reporting the issue (Sourceforge bug 2048423).

	* Fixed kernel module build issues on 2.6.27 pre-release kernels.
	Thanks to Dominique Leuenberger for reporting the issue (Sourceforge
	bug 2071170).

	* ...and other bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.08.08 changes:
	* Unity for X11 guests has been added. Unity is implemented within
	vmware-user and requires no additional setup beyond setting up the
	vmware-user application itself. Unity should work with Fusion 1.x
	releases as well as with the upcoming Workstation 6.5 release. Our
	in-house testing was with Linux guests, and they should mostly work.
	There is very little standing in the way of FreeBSD/Solaris support,
	though we've never built or tested Unity for those platforms.

	* The VMCI Linux kernel module has been added. This module provides
	high-speed datagram and socket interfaces for guest<->guest and
	host<->guest communication. It should work for all kernels beginning
	with 2.4, and for VMware products beginning with Workstation 6.5.

	* The VMCI sockets Linux kernel module has been added. It provides
	both datagram and stream socket interfaces to userlevel for use with
	VMCI. As with VMCI, it should work for kernels 2.4 or later, and for
	VMware products beginning with Workstation 6.5.

	* The command-line Toolbox has been added. This application provides
	the same functionality as the GTK Toolbox, but with a scriptable
	command-line interface. It also has some statistic retrieval commands
	that aren't found in the GTK Toolbox.

	* Fixed compilation of vmsync and vmmemctl Linux kernel modules on
	2.6.26. Thanks to Pavol Rusnak for the report (Sourceforge bug 2032683).

	* Fixed an issue with guestd's nicInfo updating mechanism. Thanks to
	Jason Lunz for the patch (not tracked on Sourceforge).

	* Fixed handling of $(DESTDIR) in automake. Thanks to Mike Auty for
	the patch (Sourceforge bug 2018802).

	* Fixed build of vmware-user using gtk 1.2. Thanks to Stephen Duncan
	for the report (Sourceforge bug 2014338).

	* Fixed compilation of lib/guestApp when using --without-x. Thanks to
	Martin Preishuber for the report (Sourceforge bug 2013568).

	* As usual, other bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.07.01 changes:
	* Fixed a backwards time synchronization issue (not tracked on
	Sourceforge). Thanks to Eric Castan for reporting it.

	* Fixed an issue where open-vm-tools configured via --without-x didn't
	compile (not tracked on Sourceforge). Thanks to Mark Foster for
	reporting the bug.

	* Other bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.06.20 changes:
	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1847750 (FreeBSD 7 & 8 builds) and Sourceforge
	bug 1981632 (build failure on Solaris). This should get open-vm-tools
	building and running on FreeBSD 7 & 8 and Solaris. Thanks to Martin
	Blapp for all the FreeBSD patches, and Jonathan Keatley for reporting
	the Solaris bug.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1968416 (packet counting in FreeBSD vmxnet).
	Thanks to Shunsuke SHINOMIYA for reporting this bug.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1983375 (Cannot specify kernel constraints).
	You can now pass --without-kernel-modules, --with-kernel-release, and
	--with-linuxdir to the ./configure script. Thanks to Craig Phillips for
	reporting this bug.

	* Other bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.06.03 changes:
	* Added the vmware-user-suid-wrapper application, with implementations
	for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. This app is needed to make correct use
	of vmware-user with the vmblock kernel module. It should have been in
	the previous code refresh, but we accidentally overlooked it.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1924246: vmhgfs on Linux properly reports the
	available space on the host. Thanks to Mikhail Krivtsov for reporting
	the bug.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1839981: we now have rudimentary `make install`
	support. On any platform, it should copy files and kernel modules to
	the location specified at build-time, and on Linux, it will additionally
	run `depmod -a` to make the kernel modules accessible to modprobe. This
	change also adds a "--with-pam-prefix" argument to the configure
	script, which controls the location of guestd's pam files.
	
	* Other bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.05.15 changes:
	* guestd no longer starts vmware-user. Packagers will need to use
	the XDG autostart spec, Xsession drop-in scripts, or other appropriate
	mechanisms to make sure that vmware-user is started as part of
	X session initialization. Please see
	http://open-vm-tools.wiki.sourceforge.net/Packaging for more details.

	* Bug fixes as usual.

open-vm-tools 2008.05.02 changes:
	* Continued Unicode support.

	* open-vm-tools now depends on libicu for codeset conversions. If you
	wish to build open-vm-tools without libicu, pass "--without--icu" when
	configuring the package. Without libicu, codeset conversions will be
	done as before, via calls to iconv.
	
	* A few more bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.04.14 changes:
	* Update the license stamp on all LGPL files.

	* Continued Unicode support.

	* Handle libdumbnet on Debian.

	* More bug fixes, including a security fix in guestd.

open-vm-tools 2008.03.19 changes:
	* Continued Unicode support.

	* A few bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.03.03 changes:
	* Bug fixes (including the ability to specify custom LDFLAGS
	at build time, thanks to Mike Auty).

	* First cut of HGFSv3 implementation.

	* Beginnings of DnDv3 implementation.

	* Add Unicode support all over the code base.

open-vm-tools 2008.02.13 changes:
	* Some bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.01.23 changes:

	* The Linux HGFS kernel module now supports writeback caching, which
	should yield better performance.

	* Added a generic Unicode-aware library to ease i18n and l10n work.

	* A bunch of bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2007.11.15 "Bandsaw" changes:

	* Kernel modules for FreeBSD, including an experimental port of HGFS to
	FreeBSD.

	* Add the vmsync driver on Linux to make VM snapshots consistent.

	* Added the xferlogs utility, the *-vm-default scripts, and the
	vm-support script.

	* Build on a wider variety of systems.

	* Lots of smaller bug fixes throughout the code.

open-vm-tools 2007.09.04 "Axe" changes:
	* Initial release of open-vm-tools.
